Parental controls in YouTube 
YouTube is catnip for the young. It's often the most requested area, the starting point to solving problems, researching everything from make-up tutorials to recipes, cartoon episodes to Minecraft guides.

YouTube is also a bit like the Wild West, in some ways unregulated and full of content you probably don't want your child getting to. You could opt for YouTube Kids, but even that's not really safe, but it is at least being addressed.

To find the content controls in YouTube:

Open the YouTube app
Tap on your profile picture top right and tap Settings
Then tap on General
Then toggle on the Restricted Mode
Again, Google states that this isn't 100 per cent accurate, but it will mean that some content flagged as inappropriate won't appear. 

Also, like search, there's nothing to stop this setting being turned off by the child user.
