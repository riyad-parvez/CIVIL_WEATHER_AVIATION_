## Live Demo
[See it in action](https://rpsdavllain.github.io/CIVIL_WEATHER_AVIATION/)

## Clone
If you have git installed in your computer, then you can clone it using git easily:

```git clone https://github.com/zonayedpca/civilAviationWeatherApp.git```

Otherwise, you may want to download it directly. After downloading, you may require some additional tasks as extract and so on. But in both case make sure you are using CLI inside the project directory where the **package.json** file is located.

## Package Install
Open you CLI tool and type this command below. You must require to install node and npm to your machine

```npm install```

## Start Development
To start the development. Write this command to your CLI:

```npm start```

## Build for Production
Once you're done with the development, you can make the production build for the application by this command:

```npm run build```

Make sure the **homepage** inside **package.json** file is exactly set as where you do want to put your production build. In my case, it's my demo URL
